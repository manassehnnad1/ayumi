_THE PRIVACY PROBLEM_

In blockchain systems, every wallet balance, transaction, and trading position is publicly visible, which poses a serious privacy risk‚Äîespecially when a wallet is linked to a known identity. This transparency means anyone can track your net worth, trading history, and financial behavior in real time, effectively exposing your personal finances to the world. For high-value users, this creates vulnerabilities ranging from targeted exploitation to reputational concerns, turning financial privacy into a critical challenge in decentralized ecosystems.

_THE SOLUTION_
**Ayumi** tackles blockchain‚Äôs privacy problem by using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to keep user balances hidden, even from smart contracts,while still enabling autonomous portfolio management. Unlike traditional DeFi, where every trade and wallet is public, Ayumi encrypts deposits via Zama‚Äôs FHEVM, allowing its AI agent to rebalance and execute trades without exposing sensitive data. Users get automated performance, provable results like ROI, and full control over what‚Äôs visible,all while staying verifiable and private. And when they want to check progress, they can decrypt their positions locally to see real-time portfolio updates.

üõ†Ô∏è How Ayumi Works

 - User logs in using their preferred crypto wallet.

 - They receive test tokens called ayUSDC to interact with the agentic system.

 - Deposits are made into Ayumi and immediately encrypted using FHEVM, ensuring privacy from the start.

 - After depositing, users are taken to a dashboard where they can see the agent manage their portfolio.

 - Users choose a rebalancing strategy for their AI agent to execute autonomously.

 - Users can decrypt their encrypted balance to view real-time portfolio progress.
